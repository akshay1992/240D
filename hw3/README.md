To run, make sure you pull the 240D repository from [here](https://github.com/akshay1992/240D) into the Allosystem directory (taken from [here](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/AlloSystem))

Then navigate to `Allosystem/240D/hw3` and run the script `run.sh`.

It should generate plots and data and store it in appropriate directories within `240D/hw3`
